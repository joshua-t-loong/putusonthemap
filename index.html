            <p>Ward 11 has been left off the mapfor far too long. Overcrowded buses, potholes, empty lots with overgrown weeds: these are but some of the many examples of how our community has been forgotten and ignored.</p>
            <p>This neglect also means we're not getting the attention or resources from City Hall that we deserve.</p>
            <p>Flavours from every continent, a vibrant and talented arts scene, local businesses and residents associations that care about our community: there are so many things that should be celebrated in Ward 11. </p>
            <p>What would you fix? What would you celebrate? Tell us how you would #PutWard11onTheMap!</p>
