          <p> For far too long Ward 11 has been neglected and forgotten - left off the map. Overcrowded buses, potholes, empty lots with overgrown weeds, there are many signs of neglect in our neighbourhoods. There is also lots to celebrate, like great local restaurants and organizations. </p>
          <p>But now it's time that Ward 11 is put on the map and it's assets are celebrated!</p>
          <p>Tell us how you think Ward 11 can be put on the map.</p>
